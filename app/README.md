# Sample Calculator Application

spin-up with command: `make dev`

navigate to `localhost:5000`

spin-down with mac OS key command: `control+c`

## Testing Needed!

This sample calculator application has bugs and needs to be tested.

### Please test:
1. number button clicks display number (am I missing anything here??)
2. operator button clicks display operator
3. "AC" button click clears calculations and displays "0"
4. number->operator->number->equals sequences display proper calculated value
5. buttons should appear a darker shade of color when focused
6. buttons should have a black border when focused

...any more you can think of?
