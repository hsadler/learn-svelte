spin-up with command:

## Testing Needed!

This sample calculator application has bugs and needs to be tested.

Please test:
    1. number button clicks display number (am I missing anything here??)
    2. operator button clicks display operator
    3. "AC" button click clears calculations and displays "0"
    4. number->operator->number->equals sequences display proper calculated value
